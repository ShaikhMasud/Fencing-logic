This project is a simple demonstration of geofencing logic, created as a base for a larger project called the Geofencing Attendance System. It uses the browser’s geolocation API to get the user’s current location and checks whether the user is within a specific range of a predefined point using basic distance calculation. If the user is inside the range, they are considered present in the geofence area. This basic logic helps in understanding how geofencing works and will be used later to build a complete attendance system based on location.
